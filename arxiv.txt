Multilevel Bayesian Framework for Modeling the Production,
Propagation and Detection of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays

The sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are unknown but are
likely nearby galaxies.  To assess  association of UHECRs and candidate
sources, we developed a  multilevel Bayesian framework.  We demonstrate this
framework using simple models similar to those in previous studies, but our
results suggest a need for more complex models; these also can be fit within
our framework.  We use MCMC methods to implement the approach to model data on
69 UHECRs observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) during 2004-2009,
using a volume-complete catalog of 17 nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) as
candidate sources.  The reported PAO data are incomplete; an early portion
(Period 1) was used to set an energy cut maximizing anisotropy, and only
cosmic rays above that cut are reported. This data-tuning proves problematic
for independent analyses.  Assuming a common, isotropic UHECR emission rate
("standard candles") and using the untuned data after Period 1, there is no
significant evidence for association of UHECRs with nearby AGNs versus an
isotropic population of sources.  If the association model is adopted, the
fraction of UHECRs  associated with these AGN is likely nonzero but well below
50%. Relatively small magnetic deflections are favored; models that assign a
large fraction of UHECRs to a single nearby source are ruled out unless very
large deflections are specified a priori.  Including Period 1 data alters the
conclusions significantly, and a simulation study suggests that the Period 1
data are anomalous, presumably due to the tuning.  Accurate and optimal
analysis of future data will likely require more complete disclosure of the
data.

Problem with CRCoincLevels.eps:
Contains Helvetica fonts (OmniGraffle can't turn this off), and the
font lines start with "%" which screws up arXiv's AutoTeX.  Reprocess
with eps2eps -> CRCoincLevels2.eps.

  The sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are unknown but are
likely nearby galaxies. To assess association of UHECRs and candidate sources,
we developed a multilevel Bayesian framework. We demonstrate this framework
using simple models similar to those in previous studies, but our results
suggest a need for more complex models; these also can be fit within our
framework. We use MCMC methods to implement the approach to model data on 69
UHECRs observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) during 2004-2009, using a
volume-complete catalog of 17 nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) as candidate
sources. The reported PAO data are incomplete; an early portion (Period 1) was
used to set an energy cut maximizing anisotropy, and only cosmic rays above
that cut are reported. This data-tuning proves problematic for independent
analyses. Assuming a common, isotropic UHECR emission rate ("standard candles")
and using the untuned data after Period 1, there is no significant evidence for
association of UHECRs with nearby AGNs versus an isotropic population of
sources. If the association model is adopted, the fraction of UHECRs associated
with these AGN is likely nonzero but well below 50%. Relatively small magnetic
deflections are favored; models that assign a large fraction of UHECRs to a
single nearby source are ruled out unless very large deflections are specified
a priori. Including Period 1 data alters the conclusions significantly, and a
simulation study suggests that the Period 1 data are anomalous, presumably due
to the tuning. Accurate and optimal analysis of future data will likely require
more complete disclosure of the data.
