\section{Introduction}

Cosmic ray particles are naturally produced, positively charged atomic nuclei
arriving from outer space with velocities close to the speed of light.  
The origin of cosmic rays is not well-understood. The Lorentz force
experienced by a charged particle in a magnetic field alters its trajectory.
Simple estimates imply that cosmic rays with energy $E \lta 10^{15}$~eV 
have trajectories so strongly bent
by the Galactic magnetic field that they are largely trapped within the
Galaxy.\footnote{An electron volt (eV) is the energy gained by an
electron accelerated through a 1~Volt potential; the upgraded Large Hadron
Collider will accelerate protons to energies $\sim 7\times 10^{12}$~eV.  We
follow the standard astronomical convention of using ``Galaxy'' and
``Galactic'' (capitalized) to refer to the Milky Way galaxy.}
The acceleration sites and the source populations are not definitively known
but probably include supernovae, pulsars, stars with strong winds, and
stellar-mass black holes.  For recent reviews, see \citet{Cronin99} and \citet{Hillas06}.
More mysterious, however, are the highest energy cosmic rays.

By 1991, large arrays of cosmic ray detectors had seen a few events with
energies $\sim 100$~EeV (where 1~EeV $=10^{18}$~eV). In the 1990's the Akeno
Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA; \cite{1992APh.....1...27C}) and the High
Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes; \cite{2002NIMPA.482..457B}) were built to
target these ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs); each detected a few
dozen cosmic rays with $E>10$~EeV.  For recent reviews, see
\cite{KO11-UHECRs,LS11-UHECRs}.
Detectable UHECRs likely emanate from relatively nearby extragalactic
sources. On the one hand their trajectories are only weakly deflected by
galactic magnetic fields so they are unconfined to the galaxy from which
they originate.  On the other hand, they are unlikely to reach us from
distant (and thus isotropically distributed) cosmological sources.  Cosmic
rays with energies above the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) limit of $\sim
50$~EeV  should scatter off of cosmic microwave background photons, losing
some of their energy to pion production with each interaction
\cite{G66-GZK,ZK66-GZK}.  Thus the universe is not transparent to UHECRs;
they are not expected to travel more than about 50 to 100 megaparsecs (Mpc;
a parsec is $\approx 3.26$ light years)
before their energies fall below the GZK limit. Notably, over this distance
scale there is significant anisotropy in the distribution of matter that
should be reflected in the arrival directions of UHECRs. Astronomers hope
that continued study of the directions and energies of UHECRs will address
the fundamental questions of the field: What phenomenon accelerates
particles to such large energies?  Which astronomical objects host the
accelerators?  What sorts of nuclei end up being energized?  In addition,
UHECRs probe galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields.

The flux of UHECRs is very small, approximately 1 per square kilometer per
century for energies $E\gta 50$ EeV.  Large detectors are needed to find
these elusive objects; the largest and most sensitive
detector to date is the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) \cite{PAO04-Proto}
in Argentina.  The
observatory uses air fluorescence telescopes and water
Cerenkov surface detectors to observe the air shower generated when a cosmic
ray interacts with nuclei in the upper atmosphere over the
observatory.  The surface detectors (SDs) operate continuously, detecting
energetic subatomic particles produced in the air shower and reaching the
ground.  The fluorescence detectors (FDs) image light from the air shower and
supplement the surface detector data for events detected on clear, dark
nights.\footnote{The FD on-time is about 13\% \cite{PAO10-GZK}, but analysis
can reveal complications preventing use of the data---e.g., obscuration due to
light cloud cover, or showers with significant development underground---so
fewer than 13\% of events have usable FD data.  These few so-called {\em
hybrid} events are important for calibrating energy measurements and provide
information about cosmic ray composition vs.\ energy.}
PAO began taking data in 2004 during construction; by 
June 2008 the PAO array comprised $\approx 1600$ SDs
covering $\approx 3000$ km$^2$, surrounded by four
fluorescence telescope stations (with six telescopes in each station)
observing the atmosphere over the array.

By 31 August 2007, PAO had detected 81 UHECRs with $E > 40$~EeV
(see \cite{PAO07-Aniso}, hereafter PAO-07), finding clear evidence of
an energy cutoff resembling the predicted GZK cutoff, i.e., a sharp drop in
the energy spectrum above $\approx 100$~EeV and a discernable pile-up of
events at energies below that \cite{PAO10-GZK}. This supports the idea that
the UHECRs must originate in the nearby universe.

The PAO team searched for correlations between the cosmic ray arrival
directions and the directions to nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN)
(initial results were reported in PAO-07; further details and a catalog of
the events are in \cite{PAO08-AGN}, hereafter PAO-08). AGN are unusually
bright cores of galaxies; there is strong (but indirect) evidence that they
contain rapidly mass-accreting supermassive black holes that eject some
material in energetic, jet-like outflows.  AGN are theoretically favored
sites for producing UHECRs; electromagnetic observations indicate particles
are accelerated to high energies near AGN.  The PAO team's analysis was
based on a significance test that counted the number of UHECRs with best-fit
directions within a critical angle, $\psi$, of an AGN in a catalog of local
AGN (more details about the catalog appear below); the number was compared
with what would be expected from an isotropic UHECR directional distribution
using a \pval.  A simple sequential approach was adopted.  The earliest half
of the data was used to tune three parameters defining the test statistic by
minimizing the \pval.  The parameters were:  $\psi$; a maximum distance,
$\Dmax$, for possible hosts; and a minimum energy, $\Eth$, for UHECRs
considered to be associated with AGN.  With these parameters tuned
($\Eth=56$~EeV, $\psi=3.1^\circ$, $\Dmax=75$~Mpc), the test was applied to
the later half of the data; 13 UHECRs in that period had $E>\Eth$.  The
resulting \pval\ of $1.7\times 10^{-3}$ was taken as indicating the data
reject the hypothesis of isotropic arrival directions ``with at least a 99\%
confidence level.''  The PAO team was careful to note that this result did
not necessarily imply that UHECRs were associated with the cataloged AGN,
but rather that they were likely to be associated with some nearby
extragalactic population with similar anisotropy.

Along with these results, the PAO team published a catalog of energy and
direction estimates for the 27 UHECRs satisfying the $E>\Eth$ criterion,
including both the earliest 14 events used to define $\Eth$, and the 13
subsequent events used to obtain the reported \pval\ (the PAO data are
proprietary; measurements of the other 54 events used in the analysis were
not published).  Their statistical result
spurred subsequent analyses of these early published PAO UHECR
arrival directions, adopting different methods and aiming to make more
specific claims about the hosts of the UHECRs.  Roughly speaking, these
analyses found similarly suggestive evidence for anisotropy, but no
conclusive evidence for any specific association hypothesis.

In late 2010, the PAO team published a revised catalog, including new data
collected through 2009 (\cite{PAO10-AnisoUpdate}; hereafter PAO-10).  An
improved analysis pipeline revised the energies of earlier events downward
by 1~EeV; accordingly, the team adopted $\Eth = 55$~EeV on the new energy
scale.  The new catalog includes measurements of 42 additional UHECRs (with
$E>\Eth$) detected from 1~September 2009 through 31~December 2010.  A repeat
of the previous analysis (adding the new events but again excluding the
early tuning events) produced a larger \pval\ of $3\times 10^{-3}$, i.e.,
{\em weaker} evidence against the isotropic hypothesis.  The team performed
a number of other analyses (including considering new candidate host
populations).  Despite the growth of the post-tuning sample size from 14 to
55, they found evidence for anisotropy weakened.  Time-resolved measures of
anisotropy provided puzzling indications that later data might have
different directional properties than early data, although the sample size
is too small to demonstrate this conclusively.

Here we describe a new framework for modeling UHECR data based on Bayesian
multilevel modeling of cosmic ray emission, propagation, and detection.
A virtue of this approach is that physical and experimental
processes have explicit representations in the framework, facilitating
exploration of various scientific hypotheses, and physical interpretation of
the results.  This is in contrast to
hypothesis testing approaches where elements such as angular and energy
thresholds only implicitly represent underlying physics, and potentially
conflate astrophysical and experimental effects (e.g., magnetic scattering
of trajectories, and measurement errors in direction).
Our framework can
handle a priori uncertainty in model parameters via marginalization. 
Marginalization also accounts for the uncertainty in such parameters via
weighted averaging, rather than fixing them at precise, tuned values.  This
eliminates the need to tune energy, angle, and distance scales with a subset
of the data that must then be excluded from a final analysis.  Such parameters
are allowed to adapt to the data, but the ``Ockham's razor'' effect associated
with marginalization penalizes models for fine-tuned degrees of freedom,
thereby accounting for the adaptation.

\mnote{WMJ11 mentioned}
Our approach builds on our earlier work on Bayesian assessment of
spatio-temporal coincidences in astronomy (see \S~3).  A recent
approximate Bayesian analysis of coincidences between UHECR and AGN
directions independently adopts some of the same ideas \citep{WMJ11-BayesUHECR};
we discuss how our approach compares with this recent analysis in
the \ref{supp}.
\enote{Add one or two sentences about frequentist work and Kim ref here;
probably little more than the reference will suffice.}

In this paper we describe our general framework, computational algorithms
for its implementation, and results from analyses based on a few
representative models.  Our models are somewhat simplistic astrophysically,
although similar to models adopted in previous studies.  We do not aim to
reach final conclusions about the sources of UHECRs; the focus here is on
developing new methodology and demonstrating the capabilities of the
approach in the context of simple models.

An important finding is that {\em thorough and accurate independent analysis
of the PAO data likely requires more data than has so far been publicly
released} by the PAO collaboration.  In particular, although our Bayesian
approach eliminates the need for tuning, in the absence of publicly available
``untuned'' data (i.e., measurements of lower-energy cosmic rays), we cannot
completely eliminate the effects of tuning from analyses of the
published data (Bayesian or otherwise).  Additionally, a Bayesian analysis can
(and should) use event-by-event (i.e., heteroskedastic) measurement
uncertainties, but these are not publicly available.  Finally, astrophysically
plausible conclusions about the sources of UHECRs will require models more
sophisticated than those we explore here (and those explored in other recent
studies).
