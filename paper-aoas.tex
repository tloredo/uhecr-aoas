\runtitle{Multilevel Models for Cosmic Rays}

\begin{abstract}
Cosmic rays are atomic nuclei with velocities close to the speed of light.
Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are approximately ten million times
more energetic than the most extreme particles produced at the Large Hadron
Collider and likely originate from nearby extragalactic sources. Important
astrophysical questions include: what phenomenon accelerates particles to such
large energies, which astronomical objects host the accelerators, and what
sorts of nuclei end up being energized? We develop a multilevel Bayesian
framework for assessing evidence for association of UHECRs and candidate source
populations that has four levels:
(1) a source property description level, including specification of a
candidate source population and the distribution of cosmic ray
intensities among sources;
(2) a cosmic ray production level, using a marked Poisson point process
to model latent properties (arrival times and energies) of cosmic rays;
(3) a propagation level, modeling deflection of cosmic ray trajectories by
cosmic magnetic fields;
(4) a detection and measurement level, accounting for detector efficiency
and exposure, and measurement errors in arrival directions and energies.
Our framework can flexibly accommodate astrophysical components anywhere on
a spectrum from simplicity to great complexity and realism.
The number of possible associations is huge even for modest-sized datasets. 
We describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating model
parameters and comparing models by computing, via Chib's method, marginal
likelihoods and Bayes factors.

We demonstrate the framework by using simple model components to analyze
observations of 69 UHECRs by the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) during the
years 2004--2009, using a volume-complete catalog of 17 nearby active
galactic nuclei as a candidate host population.  The reported data are
incomplete; an early portion of the data (``Period~1,'' with 14 events) was
used to set an energy cut maximizing a measure of anisotropy in that data;
only data for cosmic rays with energies above that cut are reported.  Also,
measurement errors are approximately summarized.  These factors are
problematic for independent analyses of PAO data.  Within the context of
``standard candle'' source models (all sources with the same isotropic
cosmic ray emission rate), and considering only the untuned data subsequent
to Period~1, there is no significant evidence favoring association of UHECRs
with nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) vs.\ attributing them to sources
drawn from an isotropic background distribution.  The highest-probability
associations are with the two nearest AGN, Centaurus~A and its neighbor,
NGC~4945.  If the association model is adopted, the fraction of UHECRs that
may be associated is likely nonzero but is constrained to be well below 50\%. 
Relatively modest magnetic deflection angular scales of $\approx 3^\circ$ to
$30^\circ$ are favored. Models that assign a large fraction of UHECRs to a
single nearby source (e.g., Centaurus~A) are ruled out unless very large
deflection scales are specified a priori, and even then they are disfavored. 
However, including the Period~1 data alters the conclusions significantly, and
a simulation study supports the idea that the Period~1 data are anomalous,
presumably due to the tuning.  Accurate and optimal analysis of future data
will likely require more complete disclosure of the data.

\subsection{Model checking}

In the \ref{supp} we describe results of two types of
tests of our models, motivated by period-to-period variability of some of
the results reported above.

First, we performed simple change point analyses to see whether the
period-to-period variation of the Bayes factors for association vs.\ isotropy
indicates the population-level properties of the detected cosmic rays vary
from period to period.  We compared versions of $M_1$ and $M_2$ that allow
model parameters to change between periods to versions that keep the
parameters the same for all periods.  We find that there is no significant
evidence for variability of model parameters from period to period.  

%That is, presuming one of the models is adequate, the apparent discrepancy
%among the Bayes factors in Table~\ref{BFTable} reflects variability that may
%be expected for these modest sample sizes.

Second, we performed predictive checks to see whether the period-to-period
Bayes factor variations are surprising in the context of either the null or
association models, essentially using the Bayes factors as goodness-of-fit
test statistics.  
We simulated data from the null (isotropic) model and compared the Bayes
factors based on the observed data with those found in the simulations; we
did the same for a representative association model.
We find that Bayes factors favoring association as large as that
found with the Period~1 PAO data are unlikely for
isotropic models.
This implies the distribution of directions in the Period~1 sample is
anisotropic, but the calculation does not address whether this may be due to
tuning or to genuine anisotropy.
For association models, the large Bayes factors for periods 1 and 2,
and the small Bayes factor in Period~3, are not individually surprising.
But it is very surprising to see a combination of large Bayes factors
for the two small subsamples, and a small Bayes factor for the large
subsample.  The full dataset thus is not comfortably fit by either
isotropic or association models.  We discuss this further below.
